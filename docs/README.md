## Features

> **Notes about the command format:**
>
> * Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g., in `todo DESCRIPTION`, `DESCRIPTION` is a
    parameter which can be used as `todo Read book`.
> * Parameters must be provided in the exact order specified.
> * Extra text entered for a command that doesn't take parameters (like `list` or `bye`) will be ignored.

### Adding a Todo: `todo`
